# Module 22 Challenge_Big Data_SparkSQL

# Overview

In this challenge, we use our knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then we use Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

# Instruction to run code

Open the Home_Sales_colab.ipynb file in Google colab.
